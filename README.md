# dnf-upgrade-to-fc40

To upgrade from Fedora 39 to Fedora 40 using an in-place method, you can use the DNF system upgrade plugin, which is a reliable and recommended approach. Here are the step-by-step instructions:

1. **Update Your Current System**  
   Before starting the upgrade, it's a good practice to update all your current software to the latest versions available for Fedora 39. This helps to avoid conflicts during the upgrade process.

   Open your terminal and execute:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf upgrade --refresh
   ```

2. **Install the DNF Upgrade Plugin**  
   If you haven't already installed the DNF plugin for system upgrades, you can install it using the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install dnf-plugin-system-upgrade
   ```

3. **Download the Upgrade Packages**  
   Now, begin downloading the packages needed for the upgrade to Fedora 40. Use the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf system-upgrade download --releasever=40
   ```
   During this process, DNF will solve dependencies and download all the necessary packages. If there are any problems (like packages with broken dependencies), DNF will report the issue, and you might have to remove some packages.

4. **Resolve Any Potential Issues**  
   If you encounter dependency issues, DNF might ask you to add `--allowerasing` to the command, which allows DNF to remove packages that are blocking the upgrade. Be cautious with this command, as it might remove packages that are critical for your system or your workflow. Always review the packages that will be removed.

5. **Start the Upgrade**  
   Once all the new packages are downloaded, initiate the upgrade process with:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf system-upgrade reboot
   ```
   This command will reboot your system. Ensure you do not interrupt this process. After rebooting, the system will be upgraded to Fedora 40, and it will complete the upgrade before finishing the boot process into your new system.

6. **Post-Upgrade Tasks**  
   After the upgrade process completes and you log into your Fedora 40 system, it's a good practice to ensure that all packages are updated:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf upgrade --refresh
   ```

7. **Check System Status**  
   Verify that the system upgrade was successful by checking the Fedora version:
   ```bash
   cat /etc/fedora-release
   ```

8. **Cleanup Old Packages**  
   Clean up old packages and cache to free up space:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf system-upgrade clean
   ```

This process should smoothly transition your Fedora installation from version 39 to version 40. Remember, backing up important data before starting the upgrade is always a good practice to prevent data loss in case something goes wrong during the upgrade.
